Hi ,

Standing true to her name, Ifra, my 3 and a half year old daughter, wants to fix and improve everything that's wrong with the world. She says she wants to be a doctor. And even though she is too little to have aspirations that high, it amazes me how a child of her age can be so enthusiastic about books, school, and studying. Since the time I enrolled her for pre-school, she has been glued to the books provided by her school. Unfortunate that my little child is, her faulty stars didn’t let her go to school beyond a week. They refused her enrollment and refunded the fees after she was diagnosed with Blood Cancer. I always dreamt of seeing Ifra treat the needy in a hospital but instead she is the one who needs help. 

It all began last year when Ifra was getting regular fever for a month. Her eyes were swelling and legs were hurting. Unbeknownst of the cause we got worried and took her to our family doctor. The doctor got suspicious of her condition and immediately suggested us to visit a Cancer specialist. The doctor’s words ‘Cancer specialist’ shook us even before cancer was detected in my daughter’s body. We hoped and prayed for it to be a regular fever and not a symptom of cancer, when we were on our way to visit another doctor. To our dismay, her reports for Bone Marrow test came positive and she was diagnosed with Blood Cancer. We immediately admitted her in the hospital and she underwent 4 cycles of Chemotherapy which lasted for 6 months. I couldn’t fathom the fact that such a tiny soul has to go through a series of such painful events. However, the treatment worked and cured her cancer. We took her home and she seemed fit and healthy for the next 6 months.
